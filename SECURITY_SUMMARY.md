# Security Summary - Operator UI Key Loading Fix

## Changes Reviewed
This PR fixes the operator UI to correctly load hex-encoded Ed25519 keys generated by `keygen.py`.

### Files Modified:
1. **operator/operator_ui.py**: Fixed key loading to read hex-encoded text instead of binary

## Security Analysis

### Vulnerabilities Found: **NONE**

CodeQL scan completed with 0 alerts.

### Changes Made:
- Changed file opening mode from binary (`"rb"`) to text (`"r"`)
- Added hex decoding using `nacl.encoding.HexEncoder`
- Added validation for empty key files
- Added validation for key length (must be 64 hex characters)

### Security Posture:
- ✅ No new dependencies added
- ✅ No changes to cryptographic operations (Ed25519 signing remains the same)
- ✅ No changes to network communication
- ✅ No changes to key generation process
- ✅ Improved input validation (catches malformed keys earlier)

### Key Security Properties Maintained:
- Ed25519 signatures - unchanged
- Key file permissions - unchanged (user responsibility)
- PoA (Proof-of-Authority) protocol - unchanged
- CBOR message encoding - unchanged

### Code Review Notes:
- The fix only changes how the key is **read** from disk
- The actual key material and cryptographic operations are identical
- Better validation provides clearer error messages without exposing key data
- No secrets or credentials exposed in error messages

## Conclusion
The operator UI key loading fix is a bug fix with no security implications. It improves the user experience by providing better validation and error messages while maintaining all existing security properties of the system.
